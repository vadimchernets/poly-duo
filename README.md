# C1M Duo

**C1M Duo — ChatGPT + Claude on iPhone.** Nothing like this exists on phones yet: ChatGPT and Claude work as a pair, ChatGPT answers and Claude checks, on the accounts you already have. Free ones are enough. No server of ours, no API key, no card, no computer. You run the strongest models of two companies together, and a paid plan adds no extra fee.

Why "nothing like it": the multi-AI tools we found (search of 2026-10-25) need a server, your own API keys, credits or a computer. Details and sources: [docs/en/evidence.md](docs/en/evidence.md#who-else-does-this).

**Tip.** Pick the model you want in the Claude and ChatGPT apps. Duo takes whatever is set there.

### How it works

On iPhone, a Shortcut calls Ask ChatGPT, then Ask Claude — actions the two apps publish themselves. Answers pass between your own apps, with no server of ours, on your own accounts. You get one checked answer on the screen and in the clipboard, in about a minute.

Duo is free and open source, and so is **Trio** (Duo plus a third voice, below). Looking for Android? See [Android](#android). The **Poly A1** app ([App Store / Google Play](https://polyhelper.ai/)) is free, installs Duo and Trio for you and walks you through every step.

Have ChatGPT and Claude? Start right away. Have one? It helps you install the other. Have neither? Gemini (Google) or Meta AI (WhatsApp, Facebook) helps you install both, free.

## Duo and Trio

- **Duo** — the pair. ChatGPT answers, Claude checks and corrects it, and you get one answer on the
  screen and in the clipboard, in about a minute. In the default mode, **Critique**, the answer
  opens with three blocks: both agree / where they differ / what to check yourself. Eleven more
  modes (debate to agreement, side by side, dispute map, decision, …) sit in the same menu or under
  📂 More… — twelve in all. Spends 1–8 messages from your own ChatGPT and Claude plans per run; the ✉ price is shown
  before you choose.
- **Trio** — Duo plus a third voice from a third company. After Claude's check, a free AI names
  only the errors and gaps both of them missed; its words come as a separate block under Claude's
  answer. It runs on any **free** key — NVIDIA first (Kimi K3, GLM-5.3, DeepSeek V4.1 Flash), then
  Google AI Studio (Gemini), OpenRouter (its free models) or Groq — or several of them: Trio
  tries every key and every free model until one answers. Limits are counted per account, not per
  key, so extra keys help only when they come from different companies. Keys are never inside the shortcut: asked once on the first run and kept in your iCloud
  Drive (`Shortcuts/poly-key.txt`).
- **Trio without a key** — on an iPhone with Apple Intelligence (iPhone 15 Pro or newer, iOS 26+) the
  third voice can be Apple Intelligence on the phone: no key, no sign-up. Same install, a different
  file: [English](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ee3c39818e2c42a49a4c7b970c634f44) ·
  [Español](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c5bf0f3dba4746038e6337a675615273) ·
  [Português](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3f7039e9624b41ff82953efce55ac312). Not for
  Russian or Ukrainian yet (Apple Intelligence does not support them).

## Install in 60 seconds

**One tap (recommended).** On your iPhone, tap the link for your language → the Shortcuts app opens → **Add**. On the first run tap **Always Allow** each time it asks about ChatGPT, Claude and the clipboard (4–6 times).

**Backup: the signed file.**

1. On your iPhone, open [`releases/`](releases) and pick your language — `en`, `es`, `pt`, `ru` or `uk`.
2. Tap **`Duo.shortcut`** (or **`Trio.shortcut`**) → **Add**.
3. Run it once and tap **Always Allow** each time it asks about ChatGPT, Claude and the clipboard (4–6 times on the first run).

The same signed files are on [polyhelper.ai/duo](https://polyhelper.ai/duo/) (site update of 2026-10-01) and in the [GitHub release](https://github.com/vadimchernets/c1m-duo/releases/tag/v1.0.0). Keep the file name
`Duo.shortcut`: the name in Shortcuts comes from it, and Siri and «another mode — same question»
find the shortcut by that name.

**If it doesn't work:** no «Ask Claude» in the action list — update the Claude app and iOS (18+). Empty answer — open both apps once. ChatGPT says «logged out» — open ChatGPT, close it, run Duo again. The permission prompt vanished before you tapped — just run it again and tap **Always Allow** at once. More: [docs/en/install.md](docs/en/install.md#if-somethings-wrong).

## Requirements

- iPhone on **iOS 18 or later** (iPad on iPadOS 18+ is expected to work, untested).
- The **ChatGPT** and **Claude** apps, installed and signed in.
- Your own ChatGPT and Claude accounts — free ones are enough: free Claude runs Sonnet 5.5 — the same
  Sonnet 5.5 as on the paid plan (paid plans also have stronger models); the Ask Claude action uses
  whichever model is set in your Claude app, and ChatGPT runs on `auto`, so with Plus or Pro you
  get the strongest models of both companies at no extra charge.
- For **Trio**: any free key (no card) — [NVIDIA](https://build.nvidia.com/settings/api-keys) first
  (email, password, then an SMS code); no SMS? [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys) or
  [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) — sign in with your Google account, no
  phone needed; or [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys) (turn on free models once in
  [privacy settings](https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy), otherwise they answer «No endpoints
  found»). Several keys, one per line, help when they are from different companies — limits are
  per account, not per key. On the first run iPhone asks for permission 4–6 times — tap
  **Always Allow** each time.
- Don't touch the screen while it runs — that cancels the run on Apple's platform.

To build from source you need macOS (the `shortcuts` CLI signs the files) and Python 3.9+ — see
[Build from source](#build-from-source).

---

*In the sources the main shortcut is still called **Poly** — `tools/build.sh` writes
`dist/<lang>/Poly.shortcut`. C1M Duo is the same shortcut released under its own name, with «Poly»
changed to «Duo» in titles, menus, help and journal file names. The rest of this page says Poly
where it describes the sources.*

## Why a pair

One model answering alone is confident about everything, including the parts it gets wrong. A
second model reading the first one's answer catches factual slips, missing angles and
overconfident claims — and it costs one extra message.

Poly runs on the Shortcuts actions the ChatGPT and Claude apps publish themselves, so a run
spends messages from your own plan, exactly like asking the question by hand.

**Use it when the answer matters.** Not for "what's the capital of France" — for the question
where being wrong is expensive: a contract clause, a diagnosis you're about to act on, a supplier,
a treatment, a piece of code going to production, a letter you can't unsend. People already do
this by hand — asking one AI, then another, then squinting at two tabs. Poly is that habit
without the tabs.

**And it keeps the argument.** When the two models disagree, Poly says so instead of averaging
them into one smooth paragraph: what each one claimed, which part is checkable, what to verify.
Two AIs agreeing is a weak signal — they read the same internet — so agreement is never presented
as proof.

```
your question
     │
     ├──→  ChatGPT drafts the answer
     │
     └──→  Claude verifies it and fixes what's wrong
                    │
                    └──→  one final answer  →  screen · clipboard · journal
```

That's **Critique**, the default mode and the only one you need on the first day. Eleven other modes
put the two models against each other in different ways — a debate, a side-by-side, a map of
where they disagree — and they stay out of your way until you want them.

<details>
<summary>All twelve modes</summary>

| Mode | What happens | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| ⚖️ **Critique** | ChatGPT answers, Claude verifies and delivers the improved final, opened by three blocks: both agree / where they differ / what to check yourself. Your default. | 3 messages |
| 🤝 **Debate to agreement** | ChatGPT takes a side, Claude objects, up to 3 rounds until one concedes; then where they agreed, what is still disputed, what is yours to decide. For life choices with no right answer. | 3–8 messages |
| 🩺 **Advisor** | Claude reviews *your own* text without rewriting it: verdict, strongest objection first. | 1 message |
| 👀 **Side by side** | Both answer independently, answers shown next to each other, nothing blended. | 2 messages |
| 🔀 **Synthesis** | Both answer blind, then one answer anchors the assembly and the other adds only what's missing. | 3 messages |
| 🧭 **Auto** | Not sure which mode fits? One classification call recommends one. | 1 + the mode |
| ⚔️ **Decision** | Fast view vs cautious view, then a referee: first steps, risks, confidence. | 3 messages |
| 🗺 **Dispute map** | Where the two agree, where they disagree, what is checkable — no verdict imposed on you. | 3 messages |
| 🥊 **Debate** | Draft → opponent attacks it → revision → judge. For the hard ones. | 4 messages |
| ❓ **Clarify** | The model asks you what's missing first, then answers. | 2 messages |
| 🎨 **Image** | Both draw the same brief blind as vector art; you get a gallery and pick. | 2–3 messages |
| ➕ **Delta** | Claude anchors, ChatGPT returns only what it would add. A cheap stand-in for Synthesis. | 2 messages |
| ℹ️ **What is Duo** | Built-in help, right inside the run. | free |

Six everyday modes sit in the main menu, the other six one tap away under **📂 More…** The ✉
badge on each entry shows the price (1–8 messages) before you choose. Which mode for which task:

## Trio — a third voice on a free key

**Trio** is the Critique pair plus a third AI from a third company. ChatGPT answers, Claude checks
and writes the final answer — exactly as in Poly — and then a third model reads the question and
both answers and names **only the errors and gaps both of them missed**. If there are none, it says
so in one line («Agree with the final answer»). Its words come back as a separate block under
Claude's answer, never merged into it, and end with a confidence line.

```
ChatGPT answers → Claude checks → third voice (NVIDIA → Gemini → OpenRouter → Groq): only what both missed
```

- **Free.** The third voice runs on free keys, no card, in this order: NVIDIA (Kimi K3, GLM-5.3,
  DeepSeek V4.1 Flash — the strongest free models), Google AI Studio (Gemini Flash), Groq (Qwen,
  gpt-oss) and OpenRouter (its `:free` models and OpenRouter's free router). Save one or several; Trio walks every model of every key until one answers — a busy model or a spent daily
  limit moves on to the next, a key with no money or an invalid key is skipped.
- **Your own paid key (optional, for experienced users).** Trio also recognises paid keys by how
  they begin: `xai-` (Grok 4.7), `sk-ant-` (Claude Opus 5 → Sonnet 5), `sk-proj-`/`sk-` (OpenAI
  GPT-6 Astra → GPT-6.1 Sol; a `sk-` + 32 hex key is DeepSeek V4 Pro). Grok and DeepSeek go first, ahead
  of the free keys — a third company; Claude and OpenAI keys go after the free ones, since those
  companies already speak in the pair. You pay your provider directly; nothing passes through us.
- **The key stays out of the shortcut.** Trio asks for it once and saves it in iCloud Drive →
  Shortcuts → `poly-key.txt`. Sharing `Trio.shortcut` never shares a key.
- **Errors in plain words.** Only if every key and model failed does the block list what each one
  answered — no money left (402), limit (429), overloaded (503), invalid key (401) — and what to do.
  Claude's answer is already in the clipboard before the third voice is asked.
- File: `dist/<lang>/Trio.shortcut` (en, es, pt, ru, uk). Getting the key: [docs/en/install.md](docs/en/install.md#trio--the-third-voice-free-key).

Trio is the one place where a free key buys a third company.

### Trio without a key

On an iPhone with Apple Intelligence (iPhone 15 Pro or newer, iOS 26 or later) there is a Trio whose third voice is Apple Intelligence through the Shortcuts action «Use Model». It needs no key and no sign-up. Links are in «Duo and Trio» above (English, Spanish, Portuguese). On any other iPhone use the free-key Trio.

## Companions

Small single-purpose shortcuts that share the same engine. They are for people who build from source
(`tools/build.sh` → `dist/`); they are not in the iCloud links yet. They call the main shortcut by the
name «Poly», so rename yours to «Poly» or edit the Run Shortcut step in each companion.


- **Poly Voice** — tap, dictate, hear the final answer read back.
- **Poly Photo** — share a photo or PDF; the text is recognized on device, then answered.
- **Poly Quiet** — the Critique pipeline with no screens at all: clipboard and journal only.
- **Poly Compress** — shrink a long text with Apple's on-device model before the pair sees it.
  This one needs Apple Intelligence hardware (A17 Pro / M-series or newer); nothing else does.
- **Poly Multi** — the pair plus any other AIs you have, semi-manually: Poly writes the prompt,
  walks you through the apps and merges everything into one document; you paste, send and copy.
  Roughly half the work of doing it by hand. Built from source, like the other companions.

> **Want the full council rather than a pair?** Poly is the pocket edition of a larger method:
> **PolyHelper** asks up to ten AIs and merges them into one document with the disagreements kept —
> free, nothing to install, on any device. Poly Multi already merges by its canon.
> → ask whoever gave you this folder for **PolyHelper C1**.

## Android

**Duo inside Poly A1 (Google Play).** The free Poly A1 app runs the same pair automatically on a free key: one AI answers, one from another company checks (NVIDIA, Google AI Studio, Groq, OpenRouter — see «How it works»). It also shows «both agree / where they differ», «Find the mistake» and a debate to agreement, can use the AI on the phone itself, and is in 11 languages. With ChatGPT and Claude subscriptions on Android the path is by hand: Share → the other app → copy the answer back. Verified on an Android emulator on 2026-10-01, not on a real phone.

**Older path: Tasker (not tested on a device).** The same idea through **Tasker** and the clipboard: Tasker prepares the prompt, opens each app in turn and picks the answer up when you copy it. It is built and structurally verified, and nobody has run it on a real phone yet — if you try it, tell us what happened at info@polyhelper.ai. Files and guide: [android/](android/), [docs/en/android.md](docs/en/android.md).

## Languages

English is the base language. Everything a user sees — menus, notifications, prompts, journal
entries, docs — comes from `locales/<lang>/`, so a new language is a folder, never a fork of the
code.

Prompts are deliberately shared across all languages. The models read them, not you, and English
works best there — every locale uses `locales/en/prompts/` by default, and any language may
override a single prompt by dropping its own file into `locales/<lang>/prompts/` if it ever needs to.

All ten are built and verified against their sources — `python3 tools/verify.py` checks that every
shipped shortcut is what the locale files produce, and that every kit matches.

| Language | Locale | | Language | Locale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| English (base) | `en` | | 日本語 | `ja` |
| العربية | `ar` | | Português | `pt` |
| Deutsch | `de` | | Русский | `ru` |
| Español | `es` | | 中文 | `zh` |
| Français | `fr` | | हिन्दी | `hi` |

Verified against the source files is not the same as run on a phone. Two of the ten have been
through a live iPhone with paid accounts, end to end, every mode but Debate to agreement; the other eight are built from
the same sources and machine-checked against them, but nobody has used them on a phone yet — if
you install one, telling us what broke is the most useful thing you can do.

How the languages are built: [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

The *answer* always comes back in the language of your question, whichever locale you install —
the prompts instruct both models to follow the user's language.

## Privacy and cost

Your question goes to the two apps you already use, and the result stays on your phone. There is
no C1M server for it to reach — nothing is collected, and there is nothing to sign up for. The
journal (`Duo-journal.md`) is a plain text file in your own iCloud Drive; delete the journal
action or the file if you don't want a history. A paid iCloud plan is not required — without
iCloud the answer still reaches your screen and clipboard, only the journal is skipped.

Message consumption comes out of your own ChatGPT and Claude plans (free or paid), 1 to 8 per run (Critique 3, Debate to agreement 3–8, Advisor 1), from the
same allowance as your normal chats — and the ✉ badge in the menu tells you the price before you
pick a mode. The code is open source under the Apache License 2.0 — see [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Limitations

Worth knowing before you install:

- **iPhone only, iOS 18 or later.** iPad is expected to work on iPadOS 18+, but it is untested.
- **Free plans have limits.** Free Claude has a daily limit; free ChatGPT has its own. See the
  note at the end of this page.
- **A run takes about a minute**, closer to two in the multi-step modes.
- **It spends messages from your own plans**, not from an API budget.
- **Touching the screen cancels the run.** That's a limit of Apple's platform, not a choice we
  made. The one exception is **Clarify**, which opens its own window and asks you to answer.
- **You can't pick the model from inside Duo.** Each app uses the model set in it — choose it in the
  Claude and ChatGPT apps first, and check it before a run that matters.
- **Very long questions are risky.** The Claude action can time out and hand back an empty result
  while Claude keeps writing inside its own app; shorter questions return reliably.

## Verified

The demo above is a rendering of the interface — the labels come from the English locale and the
answer in the last frame is the real output of the run shown, copied from the phone. Every mode except Debate to agreement (added on
2026-10-07) was run end to end on a live iPhone with paid ChatGPT and Claude accounts —
both menu levels, the finale menu, the result screen, clipboard delivery, the journal and the
permission flow. That was one phone in two of the ten languages; the other eight are built from
the same sources and machine-checked against them, and the old Tasker path for Android has never been run on a phone (the Poly A1 Android Duo was run on an emulator on 2026-10-01). Duo was also run end to end on free ChatGPT and Claude accounts (free Claude, Sonnet 5.5) on 2026-10-01.
`tools/verify.py` unpacks each signed shortcut and compares its prompts and texts with the open source files in `locales/`; it checks that the file matches the sources, not that the AIs answer well. Verified in the live run: Duo and Trio of 2026-10-01 (before Duo 5 / Trio 4); a fresh run on current iOS and app versions is still to be done and dated here. Everything known to be unverified is in Limitations above and in the [FAQ](docs/en/faq.md).

## Build from source

```bash
./tools/build.sh            # every locale: build, sign, package, verify
./tools/build.sh en         # just one
python3 tools/verify.py     # checks only
```

Requires macOS (the `shortcuts` CLI signs the files) and Python 3.9+. The builders read
`locales/<lang>/` and write `dist/<lang>/`; `tools/verify.py` unpacks the signed result and
checks that it matches what the sources produce.
